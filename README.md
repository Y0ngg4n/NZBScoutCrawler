#NZBScout Crawler
This is a crawler for the popular Website https://nzbscout.com.
I have built it mainly for integration with Radarr.

It is more like a quick and dirty approach than a good tested software.
Sometimes it wonÂ´t work for some items because it's reliability depends on the details of the post on NZBScout.

It uses multiple threads to download the NZBs concurrently. 
But because of the crawling and downloading it is much slower than already indexed sites.
It searches all Pages. And I can't guarantee that you don't get blocked from NZBScout.
Currently, it seems to work fine for me. If i see that there will be blocking I will attempt to code workarounds for it.
